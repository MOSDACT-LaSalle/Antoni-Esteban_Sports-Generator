## Concept

Framed by the digital as it mirrors the physical. 

It is not just about sports; it is about rhythm, intensity,
and the beauty of moments slipping and bouncing into chaos.

A crescendo of code and sound, pushing the limits of what happens
when we let machines interpret our most human moments of performance.
